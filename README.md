# gb01print

Python script to print images to the GB01 printer from the command line.

The GB01 is a small Bluetooth thermal printer that uses receipt paper. 
I don't know if it's been built into other cases, but mine kind of looks like a cat.
You can tell it's a GB01 because it shows up as a Bluetooth device called "GB01" when you scan for it.

This script takes a filename as its only required parameter. 
It will attempt to load the file as an image, 
connect to the first Bluetooth low energy device called "GB01" it finds,
and print the image.

    usage: gb01print.py [-h] [-e] [-E | -f LINES] [-l | -m | -d] [-A ADDRESS] [-D]
                        [-t SECONDS | -T] [-p BYTES]
                        [filename]

      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

      --scale-feed          adjust blank paper feed proportionately when resizing image
      -l, --light           use less energy for light contrast
      -m, --medium          use moderate energy for moderate contrast
      -d, --dark            use more energy for high contrast
      -A ADDRESS, --address ADDRESS

      -t SECONDS, --throttle SECONDS
                            delay between sending command queue packets (default: 0.01)
      -T, --no-throttle     don't wait while sending data
      -p BYTES, --packetsize BYTES
                            length of a command queue packet (default: 60)
